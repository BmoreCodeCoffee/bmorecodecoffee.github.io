      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        Baltimore Code and Coffee is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
        level
        of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
        size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of group participants in any form. Sexual language
        and
        imagery is not appropriate for any event or communication channel. Group participants violating these rules may
        be
        sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.
      </p>
      <p> Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and
          expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or level of
          experience
        </li>
        <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
        <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
        <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
        <li>Sustained disruption of discussion or other events</li>
        <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
        <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Enforcement</h2>

      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages
        in
        harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming
        environment
        for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.
      </p>

      <p> We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. </p>

      <h2>Reporting</h2>

      <p>
        If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Group
        organizers
        can be identified on Meetup. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for
        everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.
      </p>

      <p> You can make a report either personally or anonymously. </p>

      <h2>Anonymous Report</h2>

      <p>
        You can make an
        <RouterLink :to="{name: 'report'}">anonymous report</RouterLink>
        . We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully
        investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Report</h2>
      <p>You can make a personal report by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/baltimore-code-and-coffee/members/?op=leaders">Contacting a group organizer
          on Meetup.</a></li>
        <li>Direct messaging an organizer on the Baltimore Tech Slack. (See directions on getting access to the
          Baltimore Tech Slack on the
          <RouterLink :to="{name: 'home'}">home page</RouterLink>
          .)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When taking a personal report, our organizers may involve other organizers to ensure your report is managed
        properly. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can include someone to
        support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our team will be happy to help you contact law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel
        safe
        for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
